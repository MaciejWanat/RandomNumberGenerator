# Random Number Generator
This project contains implementation of several random number generators and various tests for these RNGs in .NET Core. This way you can easily compare how good each algorythm is in generating random numbers.

Implemented algorythms:
* Wichmann-Hill Algorithm
* Linear Congruential Algorithm
* Lehmer Algorithm

Additionally, the build-in RNG is tested.

Algorythms implementations are based on [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt767700.aspx) article.
